# Purpose:
Write python script using Jupyter Notebook, panda's libraries, and matplotlib to analyze PyBer data. We will create tables and charts to showcase relationship between the type of the city and the number of drivers and riders as well as the percentage total fares, drivers, and riders by the type of city. 
This analysis will help PyBer improve access to right insurance services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

# Results:
We found that there were 2405, 490, and 78 drivers from urban, suburban, and rural city type respectively. The average fare per ride was:

*	$24.53 in urban, 
*	$30.97 in suburban, 
*	and $34.62 in rural.

The average fare per driver was:

*	$16.57 in urban
*	$39.50 in suburban
*	and $55.49 in rural.

The total rides were:

*	1625 in urban
*	625 in suburban
*	and 125 in rural.

The total fares were:

*	$39854.38 in urban
*	$19356.33 in suburban
*	and $4327.93 in rural

Finally, we found that the end of February generated more total fare for all the types of city (i.e. urban, suburban, and rural), while the start of January was the least generating of total fare for all the types of city. (See the graph below)

# Summary:
The results revealed that there were more riders, more drivers, and more total fare generated in cities compared to rural and suburban cities. Thus, the more people in an area (urban, suburban, or rural) the more drivers, riders and fare generated.

In contrast, the results showed that less people in the area or smaller is the area (e.g. rural cities) the greater was the average fare per ride, and the average fare per driver. However, assuming that the total fares generated were the most important key for a good business, then the urban area would be the best city type to operate in.

The results also disclosed that the ride share business was more likely to generate better fares at the end of February for all types of cities. The start of January was the worst for a total fare produced.

# Limitations and Recommendations:
We could use more data, not just data for a few months in one year. This would help understand better the relationship between city types, drivers, and riders. Thus, make a more informed conclusion about insurance affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
